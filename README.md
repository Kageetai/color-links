### Initial Problem

Browsing google as a color-blind individual, it becomes frustrating after a while,
not knowing if you've already visited that link or not.

### Solution

Color Links intends to make it a bit easier to search google for the color-blind.
This chrome extension allows you to browse google with full awareness of which links
you've clicked.
